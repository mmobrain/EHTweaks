# EHTweaks

**EHTweaks** is a collection of UI enhancements and quality-of-life improvements designed specifically for the Project Ebonhold custom character progression system. 

It extends the default Project Ebonhold interface with searching, filtering, and browsing capabilities to help you plan and manage your classless builds more effectively.

## Features

### 🔍 Skill Tree Filtering
*   **Search Box**: Adds a filter input to the Skill Tree window.
*   **Smart Search**: Filters by both Ability Name and Description.
*   **Visual Feedback**: Matching nodes pulse with a green glow, while non-matching nodes are dimmed.
*   **Node Focus**: Press **Enter** in the search box to automatically jump to and center the first match in the tree.

### 📚 Ebonhold Compendium (The Browser)
*   **Skill Tree Tab**: A searchable list of every node available in the tree. 
*   **My Echoes Tab**: View all your collected Perks (Echoes) in one consolidated list.
*   **Jump-to-Tree**: Clicking a skill in the browser automatically opens the Skill Tree, scrolls to that node, and highlights it with an orange pulsing glow.

### 🪄 Smart Tooltips
*   **Rank Merging**: For skills with multiple ranks, the browser combines values into a single view (e.g., "Deals |cff00ff0010/20/30|r damage") so you can see the full progression at a glance.

### 💎 Echoes Filter
*   Adds a filter bar to the bottom of the **Echoes (Empowerment)** frame to quickly find specific perks in your collection.
